#An awesome Report 

The first thing I need to do is pick three countries I'm interested in, and select the data for those three countries

```{r}
gapbinder <- read.delim("gapminderDataFiveYear.txt")
levels(gapbinder$country)
countries <- subset(gapbinder, country == "Afghanistan" | country == "Sudan" | country == "Spain")

```
